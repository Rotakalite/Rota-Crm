The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for Sustainable Tourism CRM. Initial work involved understanding the provided codebase and addressing immediate deployment issues. Key features implemented include the Carbon Footprint report visibility for clients, and Google Cloud Storage integration for document management. A significant recurring challenge was persistent CORS errors, particularly with large file uploads from Vercel-hosted frontend to the local backend proxy, which remained unresolved despite multiple attempts. The engineer implemented chunked uploads and dynamic timeouts to support large files. The current focus shifted to building a Consumption Management and Analysis System, with backend models and API endpoints already defined, but the frontend implementation and analytics are pending.

<product_requirements>
The core product is a **Sustainable Tourism Consultancy CRM System** () with full-stack capabilities (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database). The goal is to manage client relationships, track sustainability processes, and handle document/training management, carbon footprint calculations, and statistics.

**Existing Functionality:**
*   **User Authentication:** Clerk integration for user login and role-based access (Admin/Client).
*   **Client Management:** Functionality to manage customer (hotel) information.
*   **Sustainability Process:** Tracks a 3-stage sustainability process for clients.
*   **Document Management:** Upload, download, and delete documents, now integrated with Google Cloud Storage.
*   **Training Management:** Planning and tracking of training activities.
*   **Carbon Footprint Calculation:** Functionality for recording and reporting carbon emissions.
*   **Statistics Dashboard:** Displays relevant statistics.
*   **Role-based Access Control:** Differentiates between Admin and Client roles, impacting feature visibility and data access (e.g., clients only see their own carbon reports).

**Recent Implementations:**
*   **Carbon Report Visibility:** Admin-uploaded carbon information is now visible on the respective client's dashboard, including daily/monthly/yearly calculations and a detailed report viewer modal.
*   **Google Cloud Storage Integration:** Files are now uploaded to and downloaded from Google Cloud Storage, with secure signed URLs and proper permission control. Large file uploads (up to 500MB) were targeted, with chunked upload and timeout handling implemented, though persistent CORS issues still prevent full functionality.

**Current Feature Request (Consumption Management):**
The user wants to add a Consumption Management section in the client module. This module should allow for monthly input of:
*   Electricity consumption
*   Water consumption
*   Natural gas consumption
*   Coal consumption
*   Monthly accommodation numbers (e.g., number of guests).
The system should then perform:
*   Monthly comparisons of these consumption metrics.
*   Per-person monthly comparisons.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fully resolve the persistent CORS error for large file uploads on Vercel deployments, potentially by deploying the backend to a dedicated hosting service (e.g., Railway, Render, Heroku) as suggested by the AI.
-   Complete the frontend implementation for the new Consumption Management module.
-   Develop the analytical logic for monthly and per-person consumption comparisons, including data visualization/charts for the Consumption Management module.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on implementing the Consumption Management and Analysis System feature.

**Current State of Implementation:**
*   **Backend (FastAPI):**
    *   A new MongoDB model () has been defined to store monthly consumption data for electricity, water, natural gas, coal, and accommodation numbers.
    *   Several new API endpoints have been created to support this feature:
        *   : For submitting new monthly consumption records.
        *   : To retrieve current consumption data.
        *   : To calculate and fetch monthly average consumption.
        *   : To calculate and fetch per-person monthly average consumption.
    *   The backend services were restarted to incorporate these new models and endpoints.

**Nuances:**
The backend logic for the Consumption Management is established. The next phase, according to the AI's plan, is to implement the frontend user interface for inputting consumption data and displaying the analytics.

It's important to note that despite extensive efforts, a persistent CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue for large file uploads ( endpoint) from the Vercel-hosted frontend to the backend was reported again in the very last message of the trajectory, indicating that this particular problem remains unresolved, even though the AI has shifted focus to the new Consumption Management feature. This CORS issue manifests as .
