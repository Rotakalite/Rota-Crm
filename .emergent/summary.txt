The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Rota-CRM MVP, integrating Clerk authentication, document management, and a hierarchical folder system. A significant recurring challenge throughout the development trajectory was the persistent frontend build failures due to  in the monolithic . This necessitated a laborious debugging process involving identifying, removing, and consolidating duplicate function declarations (e.g., , , , ).

Despite these frontend stability issues, key functionalities were added, including a comprehensive 3-level hierarchical folder structure with automatic and retroactive creation, a backend training management module, and frontend components for training creation and viewing. The engineer also addressed persistent CORS issues arising from dynamic Vercel deployment URLs and integrated a company logo with subsequent styling adjustments. The overall approach involved iterative debugging, manual file edits (often via ), and direct user feedback for validation, leading to a somewhat circuitous but ultimately progressive development path.

<product_requirements>
The Rota-CRM system aims to manage client consumption data, including a graphical comparison feature. The initial MVP delivered robust Clerk authentication (admin/client roles), automatic client registration with root folder creation, and secure local file storage for document operations.

Key feature requirements addressed or in progress:
1.  **Dashboard Analytics**: Display document counts by type. (Implementation detail not explicitly shown in trajectory, but mentioned as a requirement).
2.  **Hierarchical Folder Structure**: Implement a multi-level folder system:
    *   Level 0:  (root).
    *   Level 1: , , , .
    *   Level 2: Sub-subfolders (e.g., A1-A10, B1-B9, C1-C4, D1-D3).
    *   **New Level 3 Request**: Further sub-subfolders under D1, D2, D3 (e.g., D1.1-D1.4, D2.1-D2.6, D3.1-D3.6).
    *   Automatic creation for new clients and retroactive application for existing ones. Admins upload to specific folders; clients view documents. Empty folders must be visible, and A10 should sort after A9.
3.  **Training Calendar System**:
    *   Admins add training entries with fields: Eğitimin Adı (Training Name), Konusu (Subject), Katılımcı Sayısı (Number of Participants), Eğitimi Kimin Vereceği (Trainer), Tarih (Date), and Açıklama (Description).
    *   **Client Specificity**: Trainings must be associated with a specific client.
    *   Clients view assigned trainings on a calendar, with details appearing upon click.
    *   Admin panel requires a dedicated Trainings sidebar entry.
4.  **Company Branding**: Integrate the company logo into the application's header and sidebar.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture comprises a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.



-   ****:
    *   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application handling API routes, MongoDB interactions, and Clerk JWT authentication.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   **Client & Folder Management**:  was updated to generate a multi-level hierarchical structure, including the new Level 3 subfolders (D1.1-D1.4, D2.1-D2.6, D3.1-D3.6) under D1, D2, D3 columns. The  endpoint was also modified to retroactively create this expanded structure for existing clients.
        *   **Training Management**:  Pydantic model and API endpoints () for creating and retrieving training records were implemented. Backend was debugged to correctly use  and  fields, resolving initial 422 validation errors caused by expecting  and  from a duplicate  model. Duplicate POST training endpoints were also removed.
        *   **CORS**: Continually updated to resolve Vercel preview URL issues. Initial attempt with  for specific origins, then migrated to a more robust  setup with  and  to handle dynamic Vercel URLs and preflight requests.
        *   **Imports**: Added missing  and  imports.
-   ****:
    *   **Summary**: The main React component housing  for UI, routing, and data flow. It has grown monolithically, leading to recurring issues.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   **Duplicate Function Resolution**: Repeatedly debugged and removed duplicate declarations of helper functions like , , , and . The strategy evolved to declaring these as global utility functions at the top of the file and removing all other instances.
        *   **Admin Document Management**: Refactoring of  and  was a source of duplicate function declarations.  was modified to display hierarchical folders and filter documents, including natural sorting and displaying empty folders.
        *   **Training Management**:  and  components were added.  now includes a client selection dropdown and displays client information in the training list. The  was confirmed to include Eğitim Yönetimi (Training Management). The  format was adjusted for consistency with backend expectations.
        *   ****: This component was accidentally deleted and then re-added and de-duplicated.
        *   **UI/Styling**: The application header was updated to include a company logo () instead of text. Styling adjustments were made to ensure the logo alignment and sidebar text visibility (changing text colors to white on a dark background).
-   ** & **:
    *   **Summary**: Environment configuration.
    *   **Changes**: Used for  and . No direct modifications mentioned for these files' content, only their consumption.
-   ****:
    *   **Summary**: Stores the company logo for frontend display.
    *   **Changes**: A new  file was added to this directory.

<pending_tasks>
-   Frontend implementation to correctly display Level 3 subfolders (D1.1, D1.2, etc.) when Level 2 folders (D1, D2, D3) are selected in the  component.
-   Verify the display of Level 3 folders and documents within them in the frontend UI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical frontend display issue related to the newly implemented Level 3 hierarchical folder structure. The backend had successfully created the new Level 3 folders (D1.1-D1.4, D2.1-D2.6, D3.1-D3.6) under their respective Level 2 parent folders (D1, D2, D3) and this was confirmed by backend tests.

However, the user reported that when navigating into a Level 2 folder like D1 in the frontend, the Level 3 subfolders (D1.1, D1.2, etc.) were not visible. The AI engineer identified that the  component in  was likely hardcoded or only configured to display up to Level 2 subfolders. Specifically, the logic for rendering subfolders seemed to only account for , and the document display logic for , which is now insufficient given the introduction of Level 3.

The AI engineer's most recent action was an attempt to modify the  component in  at and around line 1888 to include the rendering logic for Level 3 folders when a Level 2 folder is selected, and also to ensure documents are displayed when a Level 3 folder is selected. The frontend server was then restarted after these changes. The current state is that the changes have been applied to , and the frontend has been restarted, but the user has not yet confirmed if the Level 3 folder visibility issue is resolved.

<optional_next_step>
Verify with the user if the Level 3 folders are now visible in the frontend UI as expected.
